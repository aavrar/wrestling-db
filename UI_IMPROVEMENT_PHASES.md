## Phase 1 Implementation Notes

### Data Structure from Backend:
```javascript
{
  name: "John Cena",
  bio: "Professional wrestler biography...",
  height: "6' 1\" (185 cm)", 
  weight: "251 lbs (114 kg)",
  hometown: "West Newbury, Massachusetts, USA",
  matches: [
    {
      date: "20.06.2025",
      promotion: "WWE", 
      match: "Match description..."
    }
    // ... up to 20 matches
  ],
  win: 39,
  loss: 20, 
  draw: 0,
  timeline: [] // Currently empty
}
```

### Current UI Issues Identified:
1. No match history display (major data loss)
2. No statistics visualization 
3. Poor bio formatting (wall of text)
4. Basic loading states
5. No error recovery options
6. Single-column layout wastes space
7. No data filtering or sorting
8. Missing modern UX patterns

- [ ] All wrestler data properly displayed
- [ ] Responsive design across devices
- [ ] Fast loading times (<3s)
- [ ] Accessibility score >90%
- [ ] User engagement improvements
- [ ] Zero data loss from backend
